## 2.0.0  (OAuth v2.0)
##### 2022-Apr-27
* ⚠️  Breaking change:  This library is now focused on supporting OAuth 2.0 ([#77], [#93], thanks [@HelNershingThapa]!)
* ⚠️  `xhr` and `rawxhr` options have changed slightly - check docs if you are using `options` with custom headers.
* ⚠️  osm-auth is marked as `"type": "module"` now
* ⚠️  Replace browserify with [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) for super fast build speed. Package outputs are now:
  * `"module": "./src/osm-auth.mjs"` - ESM, works with `import`
  * `"main": "./dist/osm-auth.cjs"` - CJS bundle, works with `require()`
  * `"browser": "./dist/osm-auth.iife.js"` - IIFE bundle, works in browser `<script>` tag
  * Not testing on older environments like Internet Explorer or ES5.  No promises that this will work there.
* Improve documentation around the use of all functions, some returns have changed ([#53])
